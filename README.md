### Abstract:
This project took the previous project and added a new database to it, for coupons. It required relations and associations to be build between existing dbs and the new coupons. 

### Installation Instructions:
To use, clone down both the front and the back ends. Open both, the back end with 'rails s' command, and the front with 'npm dev run'. You will also have to open the front end with 'http://localhost:5173/'.

### Context:
We were given from Thursday evening to a Tuesday evening. I'd rather not say how much time I spent on it, as it is likely to disappoint someone. Either too much time, or maybe too little. The point is, it works.

### Learning Goals:
Solidifying the basic understanding of APIs, routes, and database associations. Writing and making functional a new potential table. But most importantly, finding our ability as developers to make logical pathways, make it work, and stand behind our decisions.

### Wins + Challenges:
I felt I did a good job of integrating my new code with the existing code. I tried when I could to match the stylistic choices of the previous coders, but also make it functional in a way I understand. This leads to my second proud point, in that I spent time learning new things to make it fit the current structure. I would hope that were someone to come in, they would not realize two different sources wrote this code.
